	1. However, the difficulties in applying objective methods lead to the increasing use of subjective methods, ***especially questionnaires, for the evaluation process. [2,5,20].***
	2. Motejlek and Alpay [34] did a taxonomy focused on the application of virtual and augmented reality in education and based on FURPS+ [13] method. Their study results in categorizing the VR experience based on user interactions in four classes: General Purpose Controller, User Tracking, Specialized Controller, and No Interaction. Most VR interactions can be performed with gestures. In a study by Bhowmick et al. [4], a taxonomy of gestures for object selection in VR was de veloped. This taxonomy can be useful for interacting with different UI elements. According to their taxonomy, gestures in VR can be categorized into two main types: Hand dominance and movement with multiple body parts.
	3. Ruscella and Obeid [43] tries to cat egorize the attributes of VR applications that lead to a successful immersive experience. Accordingly, they categorize the influencing factors in: Interactiv ity, Story, Gamification, Dynamics, Co-participation, Embodiment, Immersive Technology, Meta control, and Didactic Capacity
	4. If the research topic is to consider the measurement of values related to par ticipants’ beliefs and feelings about particular topics, researchers may use self report measures (i.e., questionnaires) [16].
	5. In recent years, attention to in-VR questionnaires has increased, and several researchers have used them in their studies, e.g., [2,24,7,54,52,15,62]. [52] reports that there is no significant difference between the results of the in-VR and out VRquestionnaire in the case of presence. A similar result is also reported by [2], which confirms the previous results. Although [52] showed that embedding the questionnaire in the VR can improve the consistency of the results compared to out-VR, [2] found no significant difference. This inconsistency in the results leaves the discussion of the influence of the in-VR questionnaire design on the reported results open for further investigation.


Many researchers use VR to conduct user studies using either objective methods and sensory data (e.g., respiration sensor, brain activity measurement, blood pressure, eye tracking 39,11,23), or subjective methods and questionnaires (e.g., (1) PXI [[Development and validation of the player experience inventory  A scale to measure player experiences at the level of functional and psychosocial consequences]], (51) IPQ [[The experience of presence- Factor analytic insights]], (44) PENS [[The motivational pull of video games  A self-determination theory approach]].

> Recent studies show that when the subject of the questionnaire is related to a feature of experience that can be interrupted by exiting the environment (e.g., perception of presence), implementing the questionnaire inside the environment can lead to better consistency and reliability of the results (41) [[Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments- reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments]] ,(2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] ,(39) [[(R) Breaking the experience - Effects of questionnaires in vr user studies]] as well as an increase in motivation, engagement, and presence of participants (58) [[Engagement in in-game questionnaires perspectives from users and experts]] ,(17) [[Integrated questionnaires- maintaining presence in game environments for self-reported data acquisition]]. 


2. RQ1: How does the literature refer to or define in-VR questionnaires?
3. RQ2: What are the most commonly used UIs and interactions for in-VR questionnaires?
4. RQ3: What are future research and development opportunities for in-VR questionnaires?

We contribute to human-computer interaction (HCI) research in games with a taxonomy of in-VR questionnaires, discussing common ways to present and interact with them in VR.

 **A taxonomy is a collection of dimensions, each composed of features (22) [[A taxonomy of interaction techniques for immersive augmented reality based on an iterative literature review]].**

A review by Kim et al. (25) [[A systematic review of a virtual reality system from the perspective of user experience]] on 65 articles, categorizes the affecting factors on the user experience (UX) in VR based on user characteristics, device settings, and interaction types.


> [!Why output and plausibility should be a dimension]
> In a study by Choi et al. (9) [[Peer reviewed- a catalog of biases in questionnaires. Pre venting chronic disease]], 48 types of bias in self-report surveys are discussed and divided into three main types: Question Design, Questionnaire Design, and Questionnaire Administration. In the case of immersive experiences, Alexandrovsky et al. (2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] argue, based on a study by Schwind et al. (52) [[(R) Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]], that consistency in questionnaire administration can lead to a reduction in random errors.


> [!Why not to leave VR]
> A study by (26) [[The dream is collapsing-  the experience of exiting vr]] shows that leaving a virtual environment can lead to dis-orientation. Schwind et al. (52)[[(R) Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]]examined the effects of embedding questionnaires in a vir tual environment on participant response. A total of 36 participants took part in the study by playing a first-person shooter game in VR. They found that when questionnaires are used in the virtual world, the variance of the measurement can be kept constant, but this is not the case when questionnaires are used outside the virtual world. This difference could be due to the fact that the probability of a “Break In Presence” (BIP) is lower when using in-VR questionnaires.

On the other hand, the consistency of the interaction method with the type of content in VR can lead to a better user experience (21)[[(R) 2d, 3d or speech- a case study on which user interface is preferable for what kind of object inter action in immersive virtual reality]]. It may also reduce the time needed to interact with the UI, which can be important for long questionnaires in VR

According to Slater, (57) [[A note on presence terminology]] immersion can be defined as the objective perception of a virtual experience that is influenced by device technology.



> [!Why plausibility over presence and why output as dimension]
> by Graf and Schwind (19) [[Inconsistencies of presence questionnaires in virtual reality]] shows inconsistencies between measurement and main results. This finding is in agreement with Alexandrovsky et al. (2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] findings that presence questionnaires are not sufficient to measure BIPs. They recommend measuring presence in the virtual environment, either behaviourally or physiologically. The study by Graf and Schwind (19) [[Inconsistencies of presence questionnaires in virtual reality]]  also shows that some results are influenced by the environment in which the questionnaires are placed and the type of interaction with them.

> However, this result contradicts the results of Regal et al. (41) [[Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments- reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments]] study on the influence of using a special environment for question naires or using questionnaires as a scene object. Regal et al.  (41)  report that they could not find any influence of the questionnaire environment on the result of the presence questionnaire.

Even when questionnaires are embedded in the virtual environment, the con sistency of the design with the environment can affect the user experience. Wa gener et al. (61) [[(P) Investigating effects and user preferences of extra and intradiegetic virtual reality questionnaires]] investigated the impact of the extent of integration and consis tency of the questionnaire with the virtual environment on the user experience and the duration of the entire study. They considered four design alternatives for the questionnaire UI and categorized them as extradiegetic and intradiegetic. Their results suggest that an intradiegetic design approach can lead to higher presence, perceived user experience, and expert acceptance. However, the time required to complete the questionnaires is higher. A similar finding is also re ported by Safikhani et al. (47) [[(R) The influence of in-vr questionnaire design on the user experience]]that questionnaires with 3D layouts are more time-consuming.

For example, Wijnen et al. (63) [[Performing human-robot interaction user studies in virtual reality]] simulate a virtual museum tour where participants encounter interacting robots. They used a custom in-VR questionnaire to assess the feeling of interacting with robots in VR and the per ceived scene of presence.

Participants can interact with the questionnaire through pointer interaction. The same type of interaction is used by Krekhov et al. (28) [[Deadeye visualization re visited-Investigation of preattentiveness and applicability in virtual environments]], but a full-screen 2D UI was used to present NASA TLX and a custom questionnaire

Hepperle et al. (21)[[(R) 2d, 3d or speech- a case study on which user interface is preferable for what kind of object inter action in immersive virtual reality]].] investigated the impact of interaction type on user pref erences and performance. Their quantitative user study considered the following three main types of user input: 2D, 3D, and speech. In their study, the 2D inter face is represented by displaying 2D icons to select colors or move objects, the 3D interface is a direct interaction with virtual objects (inserting a paintbrush into a paint bucket or moving an object by grabbing it), and the speech inter face can perform prior actions via voice commands. The results show that the type of interaction can affect the user experience. A 3D UI and corresponding interaction are more appropriate when perceived presence is a critical issue. A 2D interface can be chosen when accurate or fast interaction is required. Voice input is easy to learn and suitable for long text input. Considering the study of Hepperle et al. (21)[[(R) 2d, 3d or speech- a case study on which user interface is preferable for what kind of object inter action in immersive virtual reality]]., the content of the VR appli cation should be considered when deciding on UI and interactions.
