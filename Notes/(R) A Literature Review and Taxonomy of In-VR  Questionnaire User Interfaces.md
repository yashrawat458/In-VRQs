	1. Motejlek and Alpay [34] did a taxonomy focused on the application of virtual and augmented reality in education and based on FURPS+ [13] method. Their study results in categorizing the VR experience based on user interactions in four classes: General Purpose Controller, User Tracking, Specialized Controller, and No Interaction. Most VR interactions can be performed with gestures. In a study by Bhowmick et al. [4], a taxonomy of gestures for object selection in VR was de veloped. This taxonomy can be useful for interacting with different UI elements. According to their taxonomy, gestures in VR can be categorized into two main types: Hand dominance and movement with multiple body parts.
	2. Ruscella and Obeid [43] tries to cat egorize the attributes of VR applications that lead to a successful immersive experience. Accordingly, they categorize the influencing factors in: Interactiv ity, Story, Gamification, Dynamics, Co-participation, Embodiment, Immersive Technology, Meta control, and Didactic Capacity
	3. If the research topic is to consider the measurement of values related to par ticipants’ beliefs and feelings about particular topics, researchers may use self report measures (i.e., questionnaires) [16].
	4. In recent years, attention to in-VR questionnaires has increased, and several researchers have used them in their studies, e.g., [2,24,7,54,52,15,62]. [52] reports that there is no significant difference between the results of the in-VR and out VRquestionnaire in the case of presence. A similar result is also reported by [2], which confirms the previous results. Although [52] showed that embedding the questionnaire in the VR can improve the consistency of the results compared to out-VR, [2] found no significant difference. This inconsistency in the results leaves the discussion of the influence of the in-VR questionnaire design on the reported results open for further investigation.


Many researchers use VR to conduct user studies using either objective methods and sensory data (e.g., respiration sensor, brain activity measurement, blood pressure, eye tracking 39,11,23), or subjective methods and questionnaires (e.g., (1) PXI [[Development and validation of the player experience inventory  A scale to measure player experiences at the level of functional and psychosocial consequences]], (51) IPQ [[The experience of presence- Factor analytic insights]], (44) PENS [[The motivational pull of video games  A self-determination theory approach]].

However, the difficulties in applying objective methods lead to the increasing use of subjective methods, ***especially questionnaires, for the evaluation process. [2,5,20].***

> Recent studies show that when the subject of the questionnaire is related to a feature of experience that can be interrupted by exiting the environment (e.g., perception of presence), implementing the questionnaire inside the environment can lead to better consistency and reliability of the results (4)1 [[Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments- reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments]] ,(2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] ,(39) [[Breaking the experience - Effects of questionnaires in vr user studies]] as well as an increase in motivation, engagement, and presence of participants (58) [[Engagement in in-game questionnaires perspectives from users and experts]] ,(17) [[Integrated questionnaires- maintaining presence in game environments for self-reported data acquisition]].

2. RQ1: How does the literature refer to or define in-VR questionnaires?
3. RQ2: What are the most commonly used UIs and interactions for in-VR questionnaires?
4. RQ3: What are future research and development opportunities for in-VR questionnaires?

We contribute to human-computer interaction (HCI) research in games with a taxonomy of in-VR questionnaires, discussing common ways to present and interact with them in VR.

 **A taxonomy is a collection of dimensions, each composed of features (22) [[A taxonomy of interaction techniques for immersive augmented reality based on an iterative literature review]].**

A review by Kim et al. (25) [[A systematic review of a virtual reality system from the perspective of user experience]] on 65 articles, categorizes the affecting factors on the user experience (UX) in VR based on user characteristics, device settings, and interaction types.


> [!Why output and plausibility should be a dimension]
> In a study by Choi et al. (9) [[Peer reviewed- a catalog of biases in questionnaires. Pre venting chronic disease]], 48 types of bias in self-report surveys are discussed and divided into three main types: Question Design, Questionnaire Design, and Questionnaire Administration. In the case of immersive experiences, Alexandrovsky et al. (2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] argue, based on a study by Schwind et al. (52) [[Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]], that consistency in questionnaire administration can lead to a reduction in random errors.


> [!Why not to leave VR]
> A study by (26) [[The dream is collapsing-  the experience of exiting vr]] shows that leaving a virtual environment can lead to dis-orientation.
