[[Using Presence Questionnaires in Virtual Reality.pdf]]

- They made participants give answers on 3 types of presence questionnaire (WS, IPQ, SUS), inVRQ and outVRQ, with 2 types of environments for the task (abstract and real)
- for the questionnaire environment inVRQ they kept the environment similar to how it would look in the real world ![[Pasted image 20250211142120.png]]
- The results indicate that, besides ==reducing a study’s duration and reducing disorientation==, completing questionnaires ==in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.==
- physiological measures to measure presence -> [Physiological measures of presence in stressful virtual environments](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/566570.566630)

> [!NOTE] why inVRQ?
> in doing so, the person has to re-orientate in the real-world which causes a so-called “break-in-presence (BIP)” [The VR Book].

> This means that surveying subjects about their feeling of presence potentially causes the BIP and compromises the phenomenon that the questionnaire is supposed to be measuring [26, 34, 36]
