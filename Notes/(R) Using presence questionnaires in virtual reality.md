[[Using Presence Questionnaires in Virtual Reality.pdf]]

- They made participants give answers on 3 types of presence questionnaire (WS, IPQ, SUS), inVRQ and outVRQ, with 2 types of environments for the task (abstract and real)
- for the questionnaire environment inVRQ they kept the environment similar to how it would look in the real world ![[Pasted image 20250211142120.png]]
- The results indicate that, besides ==reducing a study’s duration== and ==reducing disorientation==, completing questionnaires ==in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.==

> [!NOTE] why inVRQ?
> in doing so, the person has to re-orientate in the real-world which causes a so-called “break-in-presence (BIP)” [The VR Book].

> This means that surveying subjects about their feeling of presence potential
- y causes the BIP and compromises the phenomenon that the questionnaire is supposed to be measuring [26, 34, 36]
> > Leaving VR can cause BIPs which distort the phenomenon that presence questionnaires measure [26, 34, 36]

> [!NOTE] Potential advantages of inVRQs
> - Assessing their sense of presence becomes easier for participants when BIPs are reduced. 
> - Staying in VR reduces study duration and avoids the need to adjust after a BIP.
> - Distracting or biasing cues from the real-world, such as the experimenter, are avoided.

- Furthermore, Sanchez-Vives and Slater argued that using questionnaires causes a “methodological circularity” 
- “presence researchers must move away from questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area” [34]
- it has been shown that additional equipment to measure physiological responses can be “the greatest cause of breaks in presence”[18]

> This indicates that completing the virtual questionnaire in VR had a negligible effect on the participants’ perceived workload.

> This means that the speed with which the participants completed the questionnaire did not significantly change through leaving the VR.

> We found a systematic increase of the questionnaires’ variance when the participants filled in the questionnaires in the real-world after experiencing an abstract scene and a decrease after they experienced a realistic scene.

> Thus, all presence questionnaires used (SUS, IPQ, WS) were still reliable tools to measure presence even when participants were surveyed in VR.

> increased variability after experiencing an abstract scene and after leaving the VR indicates that, potentially, more samples (and participants) are needed to reveal statistically significant results using questionnaires which are presented in the real-world.

> We assume that removing the HMD and/or reorienting in the real-world increases the probability of a BIP occurring and potentially causes a state of confusion or uncertainty. This increases the likelihood that ratings in the real-world are higher (or lower) than in VR. This finding was supported by the variances of presence scores in VR, which were all higher after experiencing an abstract scene and lower after experiencing a realistic scene.

> Thus, we assume that the IPQ questionnaire best reflects the construct of presence.

> The increased variability of the responses and the contrast between a realistic and a less realistic scene potentially indicates that a BIP occurs (cf. [36]).

> [!NOTE] additional measure for the sense of presence
> variance in responses from real-world questionnaires is potentially an additional measure for the sense of presence when using presence questionnaires.

> A comparison of input techniques was not performed in our study and could also be subject of future work.
