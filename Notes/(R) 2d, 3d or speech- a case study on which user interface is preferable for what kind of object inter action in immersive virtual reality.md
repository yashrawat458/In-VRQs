> In an earlier study, we came up with a ﬁrst guideline that helps deciding when to use which interface [[What User Interface to Use for Virtual Reality 2D, 3D or Speech-A User Study]].

> In [[ A Survey on 3D Virtual Object Manipulation - From the Desktop to Immersive Virtual Environments]] different 3D object manipulation techniques, ranging from WIMP, to touch until mid-air interfaces are discussed. Poupyrev et al. [[Egocentric Object Manipulation in Virtual Environments - Empirical Evaluation of Interaction Techniques]] present results of a formal study that compares virtual hand and virtual pointer.

### Definitions of Interaction tasks used in this study
#### Selection
This category is a fundamental prerequisite for most types of manipulation to follow. It is necessary to specify what object to refer to, before the actual action can be performed on it or with it.
#### Manipulation 
This category includes those functions that are available after selection while only requiring just one simple interaction without any additional selection or specification of parameters

#### Position 
These are manipulations that change the position of objects. They are performed through variable numeric values without the need of a distinct selection of possible options and can occur abruptly (e.g. teleportation) or continuously (e.g. drag- ging/carrying). Our test environment includes free positioning anywhere on the horizontal plane.
#### Rotation 
This category includes manipulations that change the orientation of objects. These are also performed through arbitrary numeric values. In the test application, it is possible to rotate freely around the vertical axis. 
#### Creation 
This category is comprised of functions that change the number of active objects in the scene. They require a decision be- tween certain predefined options on lists. For instance, the participants had the possibility of choosing a piece of furniture to spawn a new object inside the virtual environment.
#### Modification 
These are functions, which change the appearance or properties of an object. An object’s state can be modified through predefined options and requires a preceding selection of which object to affect. In the test environment, we allow the re-coloring of an object (by selection of the object and color or surface structure).
#### Text Input 
This category includes the input of free texts for the independent and individual labelling of certain objects in a scene.

> A general introduction to VR interfaces can be found in Jerald [The VR Book].

> [!NOTE] drawbacks of speech interface
> While speech user interfaces are becoming more and more popular recently, discoverability still is a big issue compared to other user interfaces. While in other interfaces especially 2D interfaces one almost instantly gets an idea of the scope of functions you can use, a SI usually lacks such an overview of functionality.

> [!NOTE] Text input as a factor for loss of immersion (BIP?)
> 2D interface was rated less convincing. Due to the arbitrary nature of text inputs [34 (a book -> understanding virtual reality)] at ﬁrst, they seem inappropriate for immersive environments [40]. 
> > Whether text input generally leads to a loss of immersion is currently still under discussion [34 (a book -> understanding virtual reality),[[(P) Selection-based Text Entry in Virtual Reality]]].
> > 

> [!NOTE] in terms of overall experience 
> The 3D interface was also rated fairly well, while the 2D input mode was rated the worst.

> [!Argument] Drawbacks of Speech interface
> Also, the SI does not explicitly offer an undo option like the arrow in the opposite direction for the 2D user interface or the naturalness of the movement when using a 3D interface

### Results

![[Pasted image 20250214100949.png]]

> SI performs signiﬁcantly better than the 2D or the 3D interface or both in 8 categories. 2D and 3D only are advantageous in 4 categories.
> > Biased remark imo

> [!NOTE] which interface paradigm is appropriate (Guidelines)
> - if fun and perceived presence is the most important, a 3D interface is recommended, 
> - if there are a lot of objects to be manipulated fast and accurate a 2D interface might be the best choice
> - if the interface should be easy to learn and a lot of text needs to be entered, speech might be the best choice.

> [!NOTE] drawbacks of speech interface 
> Sometimes it is just faster to do something on your own (2D & 3D interface) than to ask someone for help (SI).

#Discussion
> Would it be easier for users to create their mental model for the SI if the interface was represented by a virtual avatar?
