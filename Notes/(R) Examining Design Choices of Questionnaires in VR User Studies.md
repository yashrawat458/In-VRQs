- 83,91 supports the assessment of questions in VR
- A dimension which they saw in literature was the attachment of interface
	- world attached
	- Head attached
	- body attached
- They did and expert online survey for inVRQs
	- experts had a positive attitude towards inVRQs
	- there is no standard method for inVRQ
	- inVRQ do not seem to be much usable (usability can be low)
	- some challenges which researchers might face are
		- Technical challenges
		- Implementation effort
		- Biases
		- Participant overload
- the dimension they initially tested are
	- Interaction modality 
		- lazer pointing
		- touching
	- Anchoring
		- world referenced
		- body referenced
