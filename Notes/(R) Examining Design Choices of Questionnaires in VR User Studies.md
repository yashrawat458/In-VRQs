[[Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies.pdf]]

## What all did the authors do
1. Extensive Literature review
2. expert online survey
3. 2 iterative user studies
---

- Iteratively implemented an in-VRQ tool and applied it on ==2 user studies== to test it out
- they did an ==extensive lit review== and found 15 papers using in-VRQs
- ![[Pasted image 20250210154958.png]]
- papers with inVRQs

- stated there are 3 levels of immersion
	1. Engagement
	2. Engrossment
	3. total immersion
- Presence relies on immersion and involvement
- Transition between realities can invoke negative feelings and add biases
- [83 (The VR Book: Human-Centered Design for Virtual Reality)],[[The dream is collapsing-  the experience of exiting vr]] supports the assessment of questions in VR
- A dimension which they saw in literature was the attachment of interface
	- world attached
	- Head attached
	- body attached
- ==They did and expert online survey for inVRQs==
	- experts had a positive attitude towards inVRQs
	- there is no standard method for inVRQ
	- inVRQ do not seem to be much usable (usability can be low)
	- some challenges which researchers might face are
		- Technical challenges
		- Implementation effort
		- Biases
		- Participant overload
- the dimension they initially tested are
	- Interaction modality 
		- lazer pointing
		- touching
	- Anchoring
		- world referenced
		- body referenced

- guidelines from research and industry which recommend ==signed distance field fonts==
- In line with Dingler et al. [[VR Reading UIs- Assessing Text Parameters for Reading in VR]], we used ==light glyphs on a dark background==

> in an experiment, To provide a context to the VE, we used a sci-fi scene (plausibility could be higher)
- no task was given to the user straight questionnaire was tested

> in another experiment, a realistic environment with mountains, trees, a river and high resolution textures was used (plausibility could be lower for 2D interfaces in 3D environment)
- a balloon shooting task was given to the user

> For demonstrating a greater variety of question types, we additionally included questions about the VE ( 1x numerical, 4x single choice with 2â€“5 items, 4x multiple choice with 5 and 16 items)

In future work, we aim to investigate text-entry and oral assessment of open-ended questions in VR as [[Enhancing Texture Perception in Virtual Reality Using 3D-Printed Hair Structures]] , [[Does It Feel Real - Using Tangibles with Different Fidelities to Build and Explore Scenes in Virtual Reality]]  and 4 surveyed experts suggested.

Based on the results from the 4 presented studies we conclude: 
2. Researchers should to apply IN VRQ S in their user studies, 
3. Pointing and world-anchoring are usable ways to realise IN VRQ S , 
4. Participants prefer using IN VRQ S over OUT-VRQ S and 
5. Researcher should be aware of slightly raised physical and mental demands when using IN VRQ S.
