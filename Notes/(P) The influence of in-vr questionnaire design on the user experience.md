The first results indicate that there is no significant difference in the case of usability and presence between different design layouts. Furthermore, we could not find a significant dif ference also for the task load except between 2D and web-based layout for mental demand and frustration as well as the duration of completing the questionnaire. The results also indicate that users generally prefer in-VR questionnaire designs to the traditional ones.

Hepperle et al. investigated the influence of 3D, 2D, and speech interactions in the case of usability and user preferences (10) [[(P) 2d, 3d or speech- a case study on which user interface is preferable for what kind of object inter action in immersive virtual reality]] . Their results indicated that 2D gives a good overview, but speech is faster and 3D is more fun.


> [!NOTE] why post test
> These questionnaires can be used as pre-, real-time, or post-assessment methods. In pre-surveys, the user is not im mersed in a virtual environment. This can lead to a less dominant difference between VR and the traditional desktop presentation of questionnaires. After immersion into the virtual environment, however, it is important to investigate the influence of the type of questionnaire presentation on user experience.


In recent years, the effect of in-VR questionnaires compared to out-VR ones on study results, such as the perception of immersion, has been investigated and demonstrated [1, 15]. As found by Putze et al. [14] in-VR questionnaire provides more reliable self-reports in comparison to the out-VR questionnaire.

The study by Krommel et al. [7] found that integrating questionnaires as a game element can lead to significantly higher participant presence. Furthermore, in-game questionnaires can increase the engagement of participants and motivate them to respond [22]. These findings can have an even more dominant influence on the studies related to immersive VR experiences.

Studies on the influence of in-VR questionnaires on outcomes and user experience have recently received more attention. Schwind et al. [18] examined the effect of filling out questionnaires in VR in a study with 36 participants. These participants were asked to fill in the following questionnaires: SUS [23], Witmer & Singer (WS) [27], IPQ and NASA TLX[9] after they had completed two game levels in VR. The authors performed these levels using a realistic and simplified design approach, and the user was asked to answer the questionnaire both in-VR and out-VR. The results showed that the in-VR questionnaire can shorten the overall study time and increase the consistency of the variance without significantly changing the survey results.


> [!NOTE] Why not leave vr
>  Leaving a virtual environment for answering questionnaires related to the presence in that environment can lead to a break in the presence (BIP) and less accurate results [20]. Putze et al. [14] conducted a study to investigate the effect of in-VR questionnaires on the BIP.


> [!NOTE] Benefits of using world anchoring and more
> Alexandrovsky et al. [1] reviewed 15 cases of in VR questionnaires and conducted a study on the applicability and acceptance of the questionnaires among general users and experts. Theyconcludedthatthemajorityofparticipants wouldpreferin-VR questionnaires over out-VR questionnaires. Accordingly, they sug gest the use of the in-VR questionnaire for VR studies. Furthermore, they investigate the influence of the position of the questionnaire in a virtual environment on the user experience. The results show that users prefer pointing and anchoring in the world over other positioning options



> [!NOTE] Intra over extra
> They also found, however, that using in-VR questionnaires can increase physical and mental demands. Wagner et al. [24] compared different design approaches in the case of the in-VR questionnaire for product design evaluation in the automo tive industry. They concluded that the user prefers the intradiegetic approach to the extra one. The implementation of the intradiegetic can also lead to a higher presence with the same usability as the extradiegetic.


Recently, Feick et al. [6] presented an in-VR questionnaire toolkit that was implemented in the Unity game engine to lower the entry barrier of using questionnaires in virtual environments.


> [!NOTE] Why post test
> Inconsistencies in the environment or interactions can lead to disturbances in the mental model that cause BIP. Accordingly, the question will be raised, whether a visually separated UI can cause a systematic bias in the results. We studied this question by comparing two different design alternatives and compare them with the out-VR questionnaire experience.



> [!NOTE] How to maintain cont.
> Two factors accompanied the design language of this toolkit to ensure a consistent VR experience: visualization and interaction. The visual representation of the toolkit was adapted by the overall concept of the virtual scene. Furthermore, the interactions follow the same rules as the other interactive objects in the environment.
