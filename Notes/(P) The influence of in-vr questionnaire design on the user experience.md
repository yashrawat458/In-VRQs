The first results indicate that there is no significant difference in the case of usability and presence between different design layouts. Furthermore, we could not find a significant dif ference also for the task load except between 2D and web-based layout for mental demand and frustration as well as the duration of completing the questionnaire. The results also indicate that users generally prefer in-VR questionnaire designs to the traditional ones.

Hepperle et al. investigated the influence of 3D, 2D, and speech interactions in the case of usability and user preferences [10]. Their results indicated that 2D gives a good overview, but speech is faster and 3D is more fun.
