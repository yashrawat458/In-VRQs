[[Breaking The Experience Effects of Questionnaires in VR User Studies.pdf]]

Administering questionnaires in VR (INVRQS) is becoming more common in contemporary re search. This is based on the intuitive notion that INVRQS may ease participation, reduce the Break in Presence (BIP) and avoid biases.

The users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of VR. Our results indicate a reduced BIP for the employed INVRQ without affecting the self-reported player experience.
