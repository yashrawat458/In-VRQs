In addition, there is no clear guide for implementing in-VR questionnaires considering UI and interaction systems.
> [!Benefits]
> Recent studies show that when the subject of the questionnaire is related to a feature of experience that can be interrupted by exiting the environment (e.g., perception of presence), implementing the questionnaire inside the environment can lead to better consistency and reliability of the results (4)1 [[Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments- reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments]] ,(2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] ,(39) [[Breaking the experience - Effects of questionnaires in vr user studies]] as well as an increase in motivation, engagement, and presence of participants (58) [[Engagement in in-game questionnaires perspectives from users and experts]] ,(17) [[Integrated questionnaires- maintaining presence in game environments for self-reported data acquisition]].

> [!Why output and plausibility should be a dimension]
> In a study by Choi et al. (9) [[Peer reviewed- a catalog of biases in questionnaires. Pre venting chronic disease]], 48 types of bias in self-report surveys are discussed and divided into three main types: Question Design, Questionnaire Design, and Questionnaire Administration. In the case of immersive experiences, Alexandrovsky et al. (2)Â [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] argue, based on a study by Schwind et al. (52) [[Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]], that consistency in questionnaire administration can lead to a reduction in random errors.

> [!Why not to leave VR]
> A study by (26) [[The dream is collapsing-  the experience of exiting vr]] shows that leaving a virtual environment can lead to dis-orientation.



> [!NOTE] Title
>  Schwind et al. - [[Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]] investigated the effect of filling out a questionnaire directly in VR. They replicated their lab in VR and asked participants to fill out presence questionnaires in physical reality and in VR after exposing participants to a VE at varying degrees of realism. Schwind et al. could not find significant differences of presence between the 2 questionnaire modalities. However, the data revealed a lower variance and, thus, higher consistency of the data when the questions were answered in VR.
