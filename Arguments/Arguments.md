In addition, there is no clear guide for implementing in-VR questionnaires considering UI and interaction systems.

On the other hand, the consistency of the interaction method with the type of content in VR can lead to a better user experience (21)[[(R) 2d, 3d or speech- a case study on which user interface is preferable for what kind of object inter action in immersive virtual reality]]. It may also reduce the time needed to interact with the UI, which can be important for long questionnaires in VR

> [!Benefits]
> Recent studies show that when the subject of the questionnaire is related to a feature of experience that can be interrupted by exiting the environment (e.g., perception of presence), implementing the questionnaire inside the environment can lead to better consistency and reliability of the results (41) [[Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments- reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments]] ,(2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] ,(39) [[(R) Breaking the experience - Effects of questionnaires in vr user studies]] as well as an increase in motivation, engagement, and presence of participants (58) [[Engagement in in-game questionnaires perspectives from users and experts]] ,(17) [[Integrated questionnaires- maintaining presence in game environments for self-reported data acquisition]].

> A sudden change of context or taking off the headset to answer the questionnaire can lead to BIP, which can bias the assessment results ,(39) [[(R) Breaking the experience - Effects of questionnaires in vr user studies]].

> [!Why output and plausibility should be a dimension]
> In a study by Choi et al. (9) [[Peer reviewed- a catalog of biases in questionnaires. Pre venting chronic disease]], 48 types of bias in self-report surveys are discussed and divided into three main types: Question Design, Questionnaire Design, and Questionnaire Administration. In the case of immersive experiences, Alexandrovsky et al. (2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] argue, based on a study by Schwind et al. (52) [[(R) Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]], that consistency in questionnaire administration can lead to a reduction in random errors.

> [!Why not to leave VR]
> A study by (26) [[The dream is collapsing-  the experience of exiting vr]] shows that leaving a virtual environment can lead to dis-orientation 
> 
> Schwind et al. (52)[[(R) Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]]examined the effects of embedding questionnaires in a vir tual environment on participant response. A total of 36 participants took part in the study by playing a first-person shooter game in VR. They found that when questionnaires are used in the virtual world, the variance of the measurement can be kept constant, but this is not the case when questionnaires are used outside the virtual world. This difference could be due to the fact that the probability of a “Break In Presence” (BIP) is lower when using in-VR questionnaires.

> [!Why plausibility over presence and why output as dimension]
> by Graf and Schwind (19) [[Inconsistencies of presence questionnaires in virtual reality]] shows inconsistencies between measurement and main results. This finding is in agreement with Alexandrovsky et al. (2) [[(R) Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies]] findings that presence questionnaires are not sufficient to measure BIPs. They recommend measuring presence in the virtual environment, either behaviourally or physiologically. The study by Graf and Schwind (19) [[Inconsistencies of presence questionnaires in virtual reality]]  also shows that some results are influenced by the environment in which the questionnaires are placed and the type of interaction with them.

> However, this result contradicts the results of Regal et al. (41) [[Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments- reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments]] study on the influence of using a special environment for question naires or using questionnaires as a scene object. Regal et al.  (41)  report that they could not find any influence of the questionnaire environment on the result of the presence questionnaire.

> [!NOTE] No significant difference in presence for inVR and outVRQs but the answers are consistent for inVRQs
>  Schwind et al. - [[(R) Using presence questionnaires in virtual reality]] investigated the effect of filling out a questionnaire directly in VR. They replicated their lab in VR and asked participants to fill out presence questionnaires in physical reality and in VR after exposing participants to a VE at varying degrees of realism. Schwind et al. could not find significant differences of presence between the 2 questionnaire modalities. However, the data revealed a lower variance and, thus, higher consistency of the data when the questions were answered in VR.

> [!NOTE] why post test
> These questionnaires can be used as pre-, real-time, or post-assessment methods. In pre-surveys, the user is not im mersed in a virtual environment. This can lead to a less dominant difference between VR and the traditional desktop presentation of questionnaires. After immersion into the virtual environment, however, it is important to investigate the influence of the type of questionnaire presentation on user experience.

> [!NOTE] Why not leave vr

Theyconcludedthatthemajorityofparticipants wouldpreferin-VR questionnaires over out-VR questionnaires. Accordingly, they sug gest the use of the in-VR questionnaire for VR studies. Furthermore, they investigate the influence of the position of the questionnaire in a virtual environment on the user experience. The results show that users prefer pointing and anchoring in the world over other positioning options

> They also found, however, that using in-VR questionnaires can increase physical and mental demands. Wagner et al. [24] compared different design approaches in the case of the in-VR questionnaire for product design evaluation in the automo tive industry. They concluded that the user prefers the intradiegetic approach to the extra one. The implementation of the intradiegetic can also lead to a higher presence with the same usability as the extradiegetic.

> [!NOTE] Why post test
> Inconsistencies in the environment or interactions can lead to disturbances in the mental model that cause BIP. Accordingly, the question will be raised, whether a visually separated UI can cause a systematic bias in the results. We studied this question by comparing two different design alternatives and compare them with the out-VR questionnaire experience.
